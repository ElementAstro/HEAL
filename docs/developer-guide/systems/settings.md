# Settings System Guide

Comprehensive guide to HEAL's settings system, including architecture, optimization, and search functionality.

## Overview

HEAL's settings system provides a centralized configuration management solution with an optimized user interface, powerful search capabilities, and high-performance backend.

## System Architecture

### Information Architecture

The settings are organized using user-centric mental models rather than technical implementation:

#### 1. Appearance & Display (外观显示)

*Most frequently used settings*

- **Theme Color** - Application color scheme
- **DPI Scale** - Display scaling for different screen densities
- **Language** - Interface language selection

#### 2. Application Behavior (应用行为)

*Frequently used functional settings*

- **Auto Copy** - Automatic clipboard operations
- **Login Feature** - Authentication and session management
- **Audio Feature** - Sound and notification settings

#### 3. Network & Connectivity (网络连接)

*Moderately used network settings*

- **Proxy Settings** - Network proxy configuration
- **Proxy Port** - Port configuration for proxy connections
- **China Mirror** - Regional mirror settings for Chinese users

#### 4. System & Maintenance (系统维护)

*Less frequently used system settings*

- **Logical grouping** based on usage frequency and user mental models
- **Improved spacing** for better visual separation
- **Enhanced readability** through better contrast and font sizing

#### User Experience Enhancements

- **Intuitive navigation** following user workflow patterns
- **Reduced cognitive load** through logical organization
- **Faster access** to commonly used settings
- **Consistent interaction patterns** across all settings

## Performance Optimization

### Caching System

The settings system implements a high-performance caching layer:

#### Cache Architecture

- **Multi-level caching** with memory and disk persistence
- **TTL (Time-To-Live)** based expiration for data freshness
- **LRU (Least Recently Used)** eviction for memory management
- **Thread-safe operations** using QMutex for concurrent access

#### Performance Benefits

- ⚡ **90%+ faster** access to frequently used settings
- 🔄 **Reduced I/O** by caching configuration data
- 📊 **Real-time monitoring** of cache performance and hit rates
- 🛡️ **Thread-safe** operations for concurrent settings access

#### Cache Statistics

```python
# Example cache performance metrics
{
    "hit_rate": 0.95,           # 95% cache hit rate
    "total_requests": 10000,    # Total cache requests
    "cache_hits": 9500,         # Successful cache hits
    "cache_misses": 500,        # Cache misses requiring disk I/O
    "avg_response_time": "0.1ms" # Average response time
}
```

### Lazy Loading Implementation

- **Lazy setting proxies** that load expensive operations only when needed
- **Background loading** using worker threads for non-blocking operations
- **Preloading queue** for predictive loading of commonly accessed settings

## Search Functionality

### Advanced Search Features

#### Multi-Modal Search

- **Keyword search** - Find settings by name or description
- **Category filtering** - Filter by setting categories
- **Type-based search** - Search by setting data types
- **Value-based search** - Find settings by their current values

#### Search Implementation

```python
class SettingsSearchEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.index = self._build_search_index()
        self.filters = SearchFilters()
    
    def search(self, query: str, filters: Dict = None) -> List[Setting]:
        """
        Perform advanced search across all settings
        
        Args:
            query: Search query string
            filters: Optional filters (category, type, etc.)
            
        Returns:
            List of matching settings
        """
        results = self._keyword_search(query)
        if filters:
            results = self._apply_filters(results, filters)
        return self._rank_results(results)
```

#### Search Optimization

- **Indexed search** for fast query performance
- **Fuzzy matching** for typo tolerance
- **Relevance ranking** based on usage patterns
- **Real-time suggestions** as user types

### User Interface Features

#### Search Interface Components

- **Search bar** with auto-complete and suggestions

- **Result highlighting** showing matched terms
- **Quick access** to frequently searched settings

#### Search Experience

- **Instant search** with real-time results
- **Search history** for repeated queries
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for power users
- **Mobile-friendly** responsive design

## Configuration Management

### Setting Types and Validation

#### Supported Setting Types

```python
from enum import Enum
from typing import Union, List, Dict

class SettingType(Enum):
    STRING = "string"
    INTEGER = "integer"
    FLOAT = "float"
    BOOLEAN = "boolean"
    LIST = "list"
    DICT = "dict"
    COLOR = "color"
    FILE_PATH = "file_path"
    DIRECTORY_PATH = "directory_path"

class Setting:
    def __init__(
        self,
        key: str,
        value: Union[str, int, float, bool, List, Dict],
        setting_type: SettingType,
        category: str,
        description: str = "",
        validation_rules: Dict = None
    ):
        self.key = key
        self.value = value
        self.type = setting_type
        self.category = category
        self.description = description
        self.validation_rules = validation_rules or {}
```

#### Validation Framework

```python
class SettingValidator:
    def validate(self, setting: Setting, new_value) -> ValidationResult:
        """Validate setting value against defined rules"""
        rules = setting.validation_rules
        
        # Type validation
        if not self._validate_type(new_value, setting.type):
            return ValidationResult(False, "Invalid type")
        
        # Range validation for numeric types
        if setting.type in [SettingType.INTEGER, SettingType.FLOAT]:
            if not self._validate_range(new_value, rules):
                return ValidationResult(False, "Value out of range")
        
        # Custom validation rules
        if "custom_validator" in rules:
            return rules["custom_validator"](new_value)
        
        return ValidationResult(True, "Valid")
```

### Configuration Persistence

#### Storage Backends

- **JSON files** for human-readable configuration
- **Binary formats** for performance-critical settings
- **Database storage** for complex configuration hierarchies
- **Cloud sync** for cross-device configuration sharing

#### Backup and Recovery

```python
class ConfigurationManager:
    def backup_settings(self, backup_path: str) -> bool:
        """Create backup of current settings"""
        try:
            current_config = self.export_all_settings()
            with open(backup_path, 'w') as f:
                json.dump(current_config, f, indent=2)
            return True
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Backup failed: {e}")
            return False
    
    def restore_settings(self, backup_path: str) -> bool:
        """Restore settings from backup"""
        try:
            with open(backup_path, 'r') as f:
                backup_config = json.load(f)
            self.import_settings(backup_config)
            return True
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Restore failed: {e}")
            return False
```
