## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Performance Manager Architecture
```python
# High-performance caching with TTL and LRU eviction
cache = SettingsCache(max_size=1000, default_ttl=300.0)

# Batch operations for reduced I/O
performance_manager.set_setting(file_path, key, value, immediate=False)

# Thread-safe operations
with QMutexLocker(self.mutex):
    # Safe concurrent access
```

### Lazy Loading Implementation
```python
# Lazy setting proxy with fallback values
proxy = LazySettingProxy('expensive_setting', loader_func, fallback_value)

# Background loading with worker threads
worker = LazyLoadWorker(setting_key, loader_func)
worker.start()  # Non-blocking operation
```

### Error Recovery System
```python
# Automatic error handling with recovery strategies
@settings_error_handler("operation_name", ErrorSeverity.MEDIUM)
def risky_operation():
    # Operation that might fail
    pass

# Multiple recovery strategies
strategy = RecoveryStrategy(
    action=RecoveryAction.RETRY,
    max_retries=3,
    retry_delay=1.0
)
```
