## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Search Engine Architecture
```python
# High-performance search with multiple algorithms
class SettingsSearchEngine:
    def search(self, query: str, filters: List[SearchFilter] = None, 
               search_type: SearchType = SearchType.FUZZY) -> List[SearchResult]
    
    def search_realtime(self, query: str, delay_ms: int = 300)
    def get_suggestions(self, partial_query: str, limit: int = 10)
```

### Integration with Settings Interface
```python
# Seamless integration with existing settings
class Setting(ScrollArea, SearchEnabledSettingsInterface):
    def _setup_search_integration(self):
        # Register all interfaces for search
        interfaces = {
            'Appearance': self.AppearanceInterface,
            'Behavior': self.BehaviorInterface,
            'Network': self.NetworkInterface,
            'System': self.SystemInterface
        }
```

### Advanced Filter System
```python
# Flexible filtering with custom functions
@dataclass
class AdvancedFilter:
    filter_type: AdvancedFilterType
    name: str
    description: str
    filter_function: Callable[[SettingItem], bool]
```
