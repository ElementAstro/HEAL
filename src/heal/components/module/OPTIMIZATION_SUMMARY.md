## Usage Examples

### Starting a Module Workflow

```python
workflow_id = workflow_manager.start_workflow(
    module_name="example_module",
    metadata={"source": "user_interface"}
)
workflow_manager.execute_next_step(workflow_id)
```

### Handling Errors with Recovery

```python
error_id = error_handler.handle_error(
    exception=e,
    category=ErrorCategory.DOWNLOAD,
    context=ErrorContext(module_name="example_module")
)
# User can then execute recovery actions
error_handler.execute_recovery_action(error_id, "retry_download")
```

### Bulk Operations

```python
bulk_operations.set_selected_modules(["mod1", "mod2", "mod3"])
operation_id = bulk_operations.enable_selected_modules()
# Progress updates automatically sent via signals
```
